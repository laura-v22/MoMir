# MoMir
An interactive dashboard to monitor Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa. Built with Python and Dash (and love).

## Requirements
The following applications/libraries are required to run the dashboard:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- base Python libraries: numpy
- plotly Python library
- dash Python library
- dash-bootstrap-components Python library

## How to use
1. Run the command "python src/app.py" in the command line.
2. Wait for the prompt to show the URL on which Dash is running (usually https://127.0.0.1:8051/).
3. Visit the URL (you may be able to CTRL+click on it) and enjoy.
4. To shut down the dashboard, close the command window or CTRL+C it and confirm the shutdown.

## Please know that
- You will need data to run the app. At the moment, we are unfortunately unable to share it, but in the near future we'll try to create some dummy data, so that anyone can check out the app.
- The app is a prototype, so it currently runs only in development mode (i.e., locally). Deployment to a server is a work in progress.

## Whodunit?
The following people worked at developing this app:
- Carlo Resta (University of Pisa)
- Laura Vignali (University of Pisa)
- Giada Bartolini (University of Pisa)
